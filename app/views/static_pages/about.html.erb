<h1>More Data So You Can Kick Safer.</h1>
	<p>
Our goal is to empower everyone who uses the Kickstarter platform while still allowing competitive decision making. The great part about Kickstarter is that projects succeed entirely on the signals they send to potential backers. It's all up to the community to determine which projects make it to the finish line.

				Kickstarter isn't a store front. If you decide to back a project, there's no guarantee that the reward you are claiming based on your contribution come to fruition when you expect it.
				</p>
				<p>
				However, our review team will provide you additional data points so that you can make informed decisions based on which promises a project creator will likely be able to meet. We examine common factors that have led to historically favorable outcomes for Kickstarter projects. And our review process will only improve as more projects are backed and funded.
				</p>
				<p>
				Clearly, when our team indicates the existence of certain success factors behind a particular project, backers should be aware that the project may still fall short of its goals. Project creators are ambitious and we love them for it! Our team bases their review on publicly available information from a creator's project site and can not verify the validity or comprehensiveness of this information.
